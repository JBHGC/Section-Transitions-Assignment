        <p class='kirbyPara'>The special move's name is Final Cutter, where Kirby pulls out a blade, goes up in midair while swinging it upward, and, once at a certain height, falls down to the ground while bringing the blade downwards. When he lands, it will also make a wave projectile that will travel a certain distance in the direction Kirby is facing. This attack deals 8% damage when Kirby swings upwards, 2% damage when swinging downwards, and 3% damage when Kirby smashes the blade for a total of 13% damage, with the wave doing 6% damage and decent knockback.</p>

      <p class='kirbyPara'>The move's name is Inhale, where Kirby opens his mouth wide open and then begins to vacuum, creating a vortex of wind. The move can be used for an infinite duration as long as the B button is held down and nothing interrupts Kirby. The move can be stopped by releasing the B button, or if Kirby flinches. Its main purpose is to suck up a nearby opponent. With an opponent inhaled and Kirby bloated by them, Kirby can't move around, and if he is in midair, his falling speed is increased. If Kirby does not do anything with the inhaled opponent, they will eventually escape in a few moments and Kirby will be knocked back. However he has various options that can be used.</p>
